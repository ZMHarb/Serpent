# Serpent

## Project Overview

This project implements the Serpent cryptographic algorithm on the Zedboard FPGA, utilizing its Zynq architecture. The aim of this project is to explore the implementation of a high-security encryption algorithm in hardware, leveraging the FPGA's parallel processing capabilities to achieve optimal performance.


## Serpent Algorithm

Serpent is a symmetric key block cipher designed to be a secure alternative to AES, with a block size of 128 bits and key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The algorithm is designed to be resistant to cryptanalysis, with a focus on providing strong security while being efficient in terms of both hardware and software implementations.

This project focuses on implementing the full Serpent encryption operations, with a complete set of transformation functions, key schedule, and substitution-permutation network (SPN).
